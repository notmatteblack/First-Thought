# First-Thought
I intend for this site to become a peaceful way to just explore the first thought that comes into your mind.

Initially words would be produced from a word bank, but after 10 or so responses I would like to reintroduce the user's own words back into the mix and track how each word develops.
e.g.
say that on my first round I enter 5 words, CAT, BOAT, CHOCOLATE.

after about 10 questions the script shows me BOAT and I answer WATER, a couple of words later I'm shown CHOCOLATE and I respond with MILK.

The word collection would look like this:

1. CAT
2. BOAT -> WATER
3. CHOCOLATE -> MILK

fast forward to 50 words later the results would be looking something like this

1. CAT -> DOG -> BONE -> MEAT -> BEEF
2. BOAT -> WATER -> SHOWER -> CLEAN -> SOAP
3. CHOCOLATE -> MILK -> CEREAL -> GRAINS -> FARMS -> SHEEP -> WOOL

These Association trails can then be shown back to the user on completing a session.
